# Enhanced Order Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive order management system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application provides role-based order management with authentication, customer search, automatic promotion application, and workflow-based order processing designed for Vietnamese market requirements.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS for utility-first styling
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for client-side navigation
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication context with role-based permissions
- **State Management**: Custom React hooks with local state management
- **Internationalization**: Vietnamese language support throughout the interface
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Authentication & Role System
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three distinct user roles (Manager, Salesperson, Warehouse)
- **Permission System**: Action-based permissions for different operations
- **Session Management**: Local storage with secure token handling
- **Protected Routes**: Route-level access control based on user permissions

- **Mock Data**: Development-ready mock services simulating backend APIs
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all services

### State Management Pattern
- **Custom Hooks**: Domain-specific hooks for state management
